Are you confused, irritated, anxious or sad when you don't find an emoji for those *bland* conversations? We are too, and that is why we came up with GiveMy*Emoji*! The **Silliest** Hack you can think about but then at the same time, pretty **useful**! Now hover over to our Website or Chrome Extension to shuffle between hundreds of emojis to find the right one to spice up your chats! ** wink wink ** We also have a smol surprise so do watch the video!

**Give life to your boring conversations!**

## About GiveMyEmoji üîß
### What
GiveMy*Emoji* is a collection of a **Website** and a **Chrome Extension** to help you find **THE** emoji that you need. It is developed using simple HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a lot of love. You see, no fancy words there! ***Surprise!*** We also have an Instagram Bot built with Selenium that sends you ASCII emoji in chat and an Instagram Filter built on Spark AR to throw Random Emojis!

### Why
Often we encounter situations where we are speechless, why not use **emojis** there instead? Unless you're talking to beep-bops ü§ñ we guarantee you that GiveMy*Emoji* is definitely going to help you out!

### How
With a super simple **User Interface** for Boomers and Babies, in both the website and the extension you have two buttons available with a Dataset of hundreds of emojis. When you click on `I LIKE`, the emoji on the screen is automatically copied, ready to spice up your bland conversations and if you click on `I HATE`, a new emoji is spinned up in no time! **Magic!**

If we talk about the Instagram Bot and Filter, when you send a `Send me an emoji` to the bot hosted over ***@givemyemoji*** on Instagram, it sends you random ASCII emojis, automated through a Selenium Script. The Filter, built using SparkAR is pretty easy to use, like every other Instagram Filter.
